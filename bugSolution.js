The solution lies in carefully examining the `package.json` file's dependencies and peerDependencies.  Ensure all dependencies are compatible, and that any peer dependencies specified are also correctly installed.  Using a dependency manager like `npm` or `yarn` helps maintain a consistent view of these dependencies and their versions. The corrected `package.json` would have the correct dependencies and peerDependencies to address the conflicts.  This would prevent unexpected errors during the Expo build and start processes.
